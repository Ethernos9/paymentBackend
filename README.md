⚡ Queue-based payment processing for high scalability and reliability.

🔗 Integration with Redis for efficient task management and job queuing.

🔄 Retry mechanisms and failure handling for payment processing.

📊 A dashboard to monitor queue activity using Bull and Bull Board.

📡 WebSocket integration to provide real-time updates on transaction statuses.

🗄️ PostgreSQL as the database, managed using Prisma ORM.
